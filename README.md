A social media platform dedicated to spreading kindness across the world. This app centers around users creating posts and performing daily kindness challenges to inspire others to do good in the world. Any kind act that is shared earns a user points and allows others to view where these kind acts happen across the world. Users compete against each other with their heartbeats (kindness points) and motivate one and another to continue being kind and grow stronger and more connected as a community. Implemented with **Kotlin** and **Firebase**.
